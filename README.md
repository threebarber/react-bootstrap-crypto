## Documentation

The motivation behind this was a personal interest in cryptocurrencies and the desire to gain more experience working with web development technologies like React and Node.js. 

The project solves the problem of tracking cryptocurrency prices. With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, it can be difficult for people to keep track of the prices of various cryptocurrencies across multiple exchanges. 

This project provides a simple single-page and easy-to-use interface for users to view the prices of different cryptocurrencies in real-time, allowing them to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or trading cryptocurrencies. I personally check it daily (although I try not to).

During the development of this project I gained experience building a React frontend, including working with components, state management, and handling user interactions. The same applies to the backend. I also gained valuable insight into refactoring code to seperate things to allow for more cleanly and easily-maintainable code.
